### Basics

At a basic level, Mace functions like any other text editor. 
When you type, text is added at the position of the cursor. 

The cursor is moved by clicking positions in the text. 
Sections of text can be selected by clicking and dragging.
You can then delete the selected text with the backspace,
delete key, or by typing a replacement.

You can scroll up and down by using the scroll wheel, 
or by clicking positions on the scroll bar. 
You can move between tabs by clicking on them in the tab
bar at the top of the screen.

### Commands

There are commands in the action bar (the textbox above 
the main textbox where your files contents go). You can
right click them to select, then when you release they are
run. If you move your cursor away from the selection before
releasing they will not be run. 

You can type the commands anythere you want and they
will work the same. 

What the different commands do should be self explantory.
