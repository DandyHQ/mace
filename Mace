Welcome to the mace text editor.

Below is a basic guide on how to use Mace.

To start, if you type you should end up adding text to the end of this message. You can click somewhere to move the cursor to that point and any more typing should go there. This should be fairly normal.

This alone is enough for Mace to count as a functioning text editor, albeit not a very useful or interesting one. Next I will introduce you to commands.

TODO: Have some examples of commands.

What should have happened is that you now have a new tab, filled with the contents of your default init file. What happened under the hood is that Mace found the word that you right clicked on (open) And ran the function 'open' in Mace's lua runtime. The function looks at the selections you have made in the current text box and opens new tabs for each of these files.

In the action bar above, you can see a variety of other commands. The save, open, close, cut, copy, paste and quit all do what you would expect.

If you edit a file and want to save it you can right click on save, which you could type yourself anywhere in the tab, or it could be the 'save' that is by default in the action bar of every newly created tab. The file will be saved as whatever text is in the tabs action bar before the colon.

I hope this guide was helpful. Have fun using Mace!
